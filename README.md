## The time, the Place, the Reason.

This may look like a code repo, but it actually is a classroom. It's a
classroom where Gregor gets schooled on the fundamentals of git. Did I
say classroom? I meant to say uterus. It is a uterus through which
Gregor will be re-birthed as a git ninja--a gitja if you will. And on
the other side of that uterus, after a long cleansing shower, I will
take on the world as a new person. A person who isn't afraid to
rebase. A person who assigns purpose to every branch, and who issues
pull requests confidently and often. Yes, many lessons will be written
upon the wall of this uterus classroom. I recognize that the journey
will have it's bumps, this is true. But furrowed brows are a trivial
price to pay as I learn the ways of modern web development.
